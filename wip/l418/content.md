# Introduction

The Vision and the Voice of the Angels of the thirty Aethyrs, reprinted from the Equinox, Volume 1, Supplement to No. 5, but here represented for the first time with an elaborate commentary by the MASTER THERION, is unique in that it attempts to describe in a perfectly sane and scientific manner spiritual experiences, and the investigations of the more subtle planes.

The first attempts to obtain these visions were made in 1900, in Mexico, where FRATER PERDURABO had journeyed in his efforts to obtain a perfect understanding of the mystic traditions and methods of attainment of every race and clime. The first two Aires were investigated on November 14 and 17, 1900. The Vision and the Voice was mysterious and terrific in character. But what he saw was not altogether beyond his previous experiences; what he heard was as unintelligible to him as William Blake to a 7th Day Adventist. He was encouraged by the evident importance of these results, but found that he was absolutely unable to proceed with the 28th Aethyr. It became evident, some 9 years later, that what stopped his further exploration of the Aethyrs in 1900 was simply that his Grade did not entitle him to go further than the 29th. In fact only a Master of the Temple, 8x = 3square x, can penetrate beyond a certain point, and further, as sections of the Comment point out, even a Master of the Temple cannot pierce through the veils surrounding the outer of these Aires.

The Seer had not thought of continuing this work for nearly 9 years. It is not at all clear how the idea came to him in 1909, during a walk through the Desert with Frater O.V., (Victor Neuburg) a Probationer of the A.'. A.'., but at Aumale a Hand suddenly smote its lightning into his heart, and he knew that now, that very day, he must take up The Vision and the Voice from the point where he had laid it down in 1900. Parallel to this, it is also possible that he had in his ruck sack one of his earliest Magical Note Books, where he had copied with infinite patience the 19 Calls or Keys obtained by Sir Edward Kelly from certain Angels and written down by Queen Elizabeth's astrologer, Dr. John Dee.

The facts that stamp these Keys or Calls are these. Over 100 squares filled with letters were obtained by these two Magicians, in a manner which no one yet has quite understood. Dee would have one or more of these tables (as a rule 49 by 49) — some full, others lettered only on alternate squares — before him on a writing table. Kelly would sit at what they called the Holy Table, and gaze into a "Shewstone" in which he would see an Angel, who would point with a wand to letters on one of these charts in succession. Kelly would report, for example, "He points to column 6, rank 31", and so on, apparently not mentioning the letter, which Dee found and wrote down from the "Table" before him. When the Angel had finished, the message was rewritten backwards. It had been dictated backwards as being too dangerous to communicate forwards — each word being in its nature so powerful that its direct communication would have evoked forces which were not wanted at that time.

These Keys being re-written backwards, there then appeared conjurations in a language which they called "Enochian", or "Angelic". It is not a jargon; it has a grammar and a syntax of its own. It is far more sonorous, stately and impressive than even Greek or Sanskrit and the English translations, though in places difficult to understand, contain passages of a sustained sublimity that Shakespeare, Milton and the Bible do not surpass.

"Can the Wings of the Wind understand your voices of Wonder? O Ye! The Second of the First! whom the burning flames have framed in the depths of my Jaws! Whom I have prepared as cups for a wedding, or as flowers in their beauty for the chamber of Righteousness! Stronger are your feet than the barren stone! and mightier are your voices than the manifold winds! For you are become a building such as is not, save in the mind of the All-Powerful." (Second Key)

There are nineteen of these Keys: the first two conjuring the element called Spirit; the next sixteen invoke the Four Elements; each sub-divided into four; the nineteenth, by changing two names, may be used to invoke any one of what are called the thirty "Aethyrs" or "Aires".

The genuineness of these Keys, altogether apart from any critical observation, is guaranteed by the fact that anyone with the smallest capacity for Magick finds that they work. The Seer had used these Keys a great deal, — always with excellent effect. It was in Mexico that the idea occurred to him to discover for himself what these Aethyrs really were, by invoking them in turn by means of the nineteenth key, and, by skrying in the Spirit Vision, judge their nature by what he saw and heard.

It was then in Aumale, that he prepared to commence once more the investigations of these Aethyrs, and accordingly bought a number of notebooks. After dinner, on the 23rd of November, 1909, he invoked the 28th Aethyr by means of this 19th Key. When it was compared with those of the 29th and 30th Aethyrs, — lo and behold, there were exhibited the same peculiarities of subject and style. This is true also of the 27th, and so on to the 24th; yet there is a continuous advance towards coherence both in each Aethyr itself, and as regards its neighbour. The subject shows solemnity and sublimity, as well as the tendency to fit in with those conceptions of the Cosmos, those mystic Laws of Nature, and those ideas of transcendental Truth which had already been foreshadowed in The Book of the Law (Vernal Equinox, 1904), and the more exalted of the trances which the Seer had experienced prior to this date.

The Method of obtaining The Vision and the Voice was as follows.

The Seer had with him a great golden topaz (set in a Calvary Cross of six squares, made of wood, and painted vermillion) which was engraved with a Greek Cross of five squares charged with the Rose of 49 petals. He held this, as a rule, in his hand. After choosing a spot where he was not likely to be disturbed he would take this stone and recite the Enochian Call, and after satisfying himself that the forces invoked were actually present, made the topaz play a part not unlike that of the looking glass in the case of Alice. (He had long learned not to trouble himself to travel to any particular place in his Body of Light. He realized that Space was not a thing in itself, but merely a convenient category [one of many such] by reference to which we can distinguish objects from each other.) He would then describe what he saw and repeat what he heard, and Frater O.V., the Scribe, would write down his words, and incidentally observe any phenomena which struck him as peculiar. (For instance, He would at times pass into a deep trance so that many minutes might pass between two successive sentences, as the text to the later Aethyrs shows.)

They walked steadily through the Desert, invoking the Aethyrs, one by one, at convenient times and places, or when the Spirit moved them. As a rule, one Aethyr was obtained every day. Bou-Sada was reached on November 30th; on December 8th they started again through the desert for Biskra which they reached on December 16th, completing the work on the 19th. By the time Bou-Sada was reached, and they had arrived at the 20th Aethyr, the Seer began to understand that these visions were, so to speak, cosmopolitan. They brought all systems of Magical doctrine into harmonious relation. The symbolism of Asiatic cults; the ideas of the Qabalah, both Jewish and Greek; the Arcana of the Gnostics; the Pagan Pantheon, from Mithras to Mars; the Mysteries of Ancient Khem; the Rites of Eleusis; the Scandinavian Sagas; Celtic and Druidical ritual; Mexican and Polynesian traditions; the Mysticism of Molinos no less than that of Islam,— all these fell into their proper places without the slightest tendency to quarrel. The whole of the past Aeon, in short, appeared in detailed perspective, and each element therefore surrendered its sovereignty to Horus, the Crowned and Conquering Child, the Lord of the Aeon announced in The Book of the Law


Love is the law, love under will.

### THE CALL OR KEY OF THE THIRTY AETHYRS

O Ye Heavens which dwell in the first Aire1, ye are mighty in the parts of the Earth, and execute therein the Judgment of the Highest! Unto you it is said: Behold the Face of your God, the beginning of Comfort, whose eyes are the brightness of the Heavens, which provided you for the Government of the Earth, and her unspeakable variety, furnishing you with the power of understanding to dispose of all things according to the Foresight of Him that Sitteth on the Holy Throne2, and rose up in the Beginning, saying: The Earth, let her be governed by her parts, and let there be Division in her, that the glory of her may be always ecstasy and imitation of orgasm. Her course, let it run with the Heavens; and as an handmaid let her serve them. One season, let it confound another, and let there be no creature upon or within her the same. All her members, let them differ in their qualities, and let there be no one Creature equal with another. The reasonable Creatures of the Earth, and Men, let them vex and weed out one another; and their dwelling-places, let them forget their Names. The work of man and his pomp, let them be defaced. His building, let it be a Cave for the Beast of the Field! Confound her understanding with darkness! For why? It repenteth me concerning the Virgin and the Man. One while let her be known, and another while a stranger: because she is the bed of an Harlot, and the dwelling-place of him that is fallen.

O ye Heavens arise! The lower heavens beneath you, let them serve you! Govern those that govern! Cast down such as fall. Bring forth with those that increase, and destroy the rotten. No place let it remain in one number. Add an diminish until the stars be numbered. Arise! Move! and appear before the Covenant of His mouth, which He hath sworn unto us in His Justice. Open the Mysteries of your Creation, and make us partakers of THE UNDEFILED KNOWLEDGE.

Note: In various footnotes to the text, Crowley makes correspondences to Enochian letters and Astrological symbols. An ambiguity exists in regard to the letter "T". The Germer/Thelema Publishing Edition of 1952 e.v. makes extensive use of symbols for Astrological concepts, and it is not possible to clearly differentiate the signs for Leo and Caput Draconis in all instances, since the handwritten symbols for these two correspondences are usually indistinguishable in the Germer edition. Enochian corresponds directly to English letters, while the astrological correspondences come from correspondences to Hebrew letters. There are two letters in Hebrew which are loosely rendered "T" in English/Enochian; Tet = Leo and Taw = Caput Draconis/Saturn. Crowley uses both Leo and Caput Draconis for the Enochian "T" in his notes. Where Leo or Caput Draconis is made clear by the context of the note, the rendering has been duplicated here. Where this is ambiguous, T is assumed to be matched to Leo in this text. F.I.Regardie, in his edition, usually renders the Enochian "T" as Caput Draconis, a practice reversed in this present version. A concise edition should therefore be made only after careful examination of the notations for every instance of the use of the Enochian "T", with citation of uncertainty in regard to Leo or Caput Draconis where Crowley's intention is unclear.

### The Cry of the 30th Aethyr Which is Called TEX^[TEX = ♌♍A]

I AM in a vast crystal cube in the form of the Great God Harpocrates. This cube is surrounded by a sphere.^[cf. AL, II, 7] About me are four archangels in black robes, their wings and armour lined out in white.

In the North^[North: Destruction = the Old Formula is abrogated.] is a book on whose back and front are A.M.B.Z.^[♉♒♈♌. The Forthsaying of the New Aeon.] in Enochian characters. (ENO:zENO:bENO:mENO:a)

Within it is written:

I AM, the surrounding of the four.

Lift up your heads, O Houses of Eternity: for my Father goeth forth to judge the World. One Light, let it become a thousand, and one sword ten thousand, that no man hide him from my Father's eye in the Day of Judgment of my God. Let the Gods hide themselves: let the Angels be troubled and flee away: for the Eye of My Father is open, and the Book of the Aeons is fallen.

Arise! Arise! Arise! Let the Light of the Sight of Time be extinguished: let the Darkness cover all things: for my Father goeth forth to seek a spouse to replace her who is fallen and defiled.

Seal the book with the seals of the Stars Concealed: for the Rivers have rushed together and the Name HEB:HehHEB:VauHEB:HehHEB:Yodis broken in a thousand pieces (against the Cubic Stone).

Tremble ye, O Pillars of the Universe5^[cf. AL, III, 71. Also LIL.] , for Eternity is in travail of a Terrible Child; she shall bring forth an universe of Darkness, whence shall leap forth a spark that shall put his father to flight.

The Obelisks are broken; the stars have rushed together: the Light hath plunged into the Abyss: the Heavens are mixed with Hell.

My Father shall not hear their Noise: His ears are closed: His eyes are covered with the clouds of Night.

The End! the End! the End: For the Eye of Shiva He hath opened: the Universe is naked before Him: for the Aeon of Saturn leaneth toward the Bosom of Death.^[♄ = 400 Death = 50 400 + 50 = 450 ΝΥ etc.]

![Figure: This is an isosceles triangle with height about 7 times the base. It extends with base on a true vertical from the left. A line extends vertically upward from the apex, equal to the length of the base. A trefoliate of three isosceles triangles of base slightly smaller than the first triangle and sides equal to the first triangle is created at the upper tip of the line. The tree component triangles of the terfolate meet the upper tip of the line with their apices — one vertically and two to right and left.](img/iso_tri.jpg)^[Represents the formula of Drawing all to a point: whence blooms erect a Triple Triad.]

The Angel of the East^[East. Adepts: cleansed of their Blood, and brought to Light. = There is a way to light through giving up one's Blood. (See 12th Aethyr) hath a book of red written in letters of Blue A.B.F.M.A.^[[9] ♉♈☋♒♉ = Opening of New Aeon.] in Enochian (ENO:a ENO:m ENO:f ENO:b ENO:a). The Book grows before my eyes and filleth the Whole Heaven.

Within: "It is Written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord Thy God."

I see above the Book a multitude of white-robed Ones from whom droppeth a great rain of Blood^[Symbolism of the Cup of Babalon.]; but above them is a Golden Sun, having an eye, whence a great Light^[This refers to Kether &mdash; Horus.].

I turned me to the South^[South. Silence. Marriage in Binah. = This leads to the Rapture of the Ineffable Union. Closing of Old Aeon.]: and read therein:

Seal up the Book! Speak not that which thou seest and reveal it unto none: for the ear is not framed that shall hear it: nor the tongue that can speak it!

O Lord God, blessed, blessed, blessed be Thou for ever!

Thy Shadow is as great Light.

Thy Name is as the Breath of Love across all Worlds.

![Figure: This is a swastika or fylfot cross. It is widdershins, with each bend going to the right when viewed down one arm from the center. All elements are either vertical or horizontal, none diagonal.](img/Svastika.jpg)

(A vast Svastika is shewn unto me behind the Angel with the Book.) ^[The Swastika has 17 squares out of 25, The Pentagram, or Human square. It is also HEB:Aleph = Harpocrates, Bacchus Diphues, Parzival, etc., the Pure Fool, the Wanderer, who weds the King's Daughter.]

Rend your garments, O ye clouds! Uncover yourselves! for the Love of My Son!

Who are they that trouble thee?

Who are they that slew thee?

O Light! Come thou, who art joined with me to bruise the Dragon's head ^[Means the Stooping Dragon (see 4x = 7square x ritual): but also the phrase = break the Maidenhead of Draco (Nuit).]. We, who are wedded, and the Earth perceiveth it not!

O that Our Bed were seen of Men, that they might rejoice in My Fertility: that My Sister might partake of My Great Light.

O Light of God, when wilt thou find the heart of man — write not! I would not that men know the Sorrow of my Heart, Amen!

I turned me to the West^[West. Fate (Refusing Initiation.) = The alternative is despair — of loneliness.], and the Archangel bore a flaming Book, on which was written AN^[♉♏ AN (Hebrew) means Pain: NA = Failure. These = 51 = 3x17. Note the Three Vibrations as spoiling the ideas of 17 (IAC). The Doom of the Old Aeon.] in Enochian (ENO:nENO:a). Within was drawn a fiery scorpion, yet cold withal.^[♏ = נ = Fish = Jesus.]

Until the Book of the East be opened!

Until the hour sound!

Until the Voice vibrate!

Until it pierce my Depth;

Look not on High!

Look not Beneath!

For thou wilt find a life which is as Death: or a Death which should be infinite.

For Thou art submitted to the Four: Five thou shalt find, but Seven is lone and far.^[Tetragrammaton — the blind forces of the Elements — bind the Uninitiate. He may attain to the Pentagram — Jeheshua —the Man Master of those Elements. But he cannot reach Seven — Babalon. (See Sigil of A.·. A.·. 77 + 7 + 7 + 77 = 156 Babalon)]

For she is "lone and far", i.e., beyond the Abyss.

O Lord God, let Thy Spirit hither unto me!

For I am lost in the night of infinite pain: no hope: no God: no resurrection: no end: I fall: I fear.

O Saviour of the World, bruise Thou my Head with Thy foot to save the world, that once again I touch Him whom I slew, that in my death I feel the radiance and the heat of the moving of Thy Robes!

Let us alone! What have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus of Nazareth?

Go! Go!

If I keep silence — Or if I speak each word is anguish without hope.

And I heard the Aethyr cry aloud "Return! Return! Return! For the work is ended; and the Book is shut; and let the glory be to God the Blessed for ever in the Aeons, Amen." Thus far is the voice of TEX and no more.

### The Cry of the 29th Aethyr, Which is Called RII^[RII = ♓♐♐ = קסס = 220. 220 is the number of verses of The Book of the Law: And this book brings about the disruption described in this Aethyr.]

The sky appears covered with stars of gold; the background is of green. But the impression is also of darkness.

An immense eagle-angel is before me. His wings seem to hide all the Heaven.^[In the East. He thus represents the immediate future: and this is dark, Bewildering, and terrifying.]

He cried aloud saying: The Voice of the Lord upon the Waters: the Terror of God upon Mankind. The voice of the Lord maketh the Skies to tremble: the Stars are troubled: the Aires fall. The First Voice Speaketh and saith: Cursed, cursed be the Earth, for her iniquity is great. Oh Lord! Let Thy Mercy be lost in the great Deep! Open thine eyes of Flame and Light, O God, upon the wicked! Lighten thine Eyes! The Clamour of Thy Voice, let it smite down the Mountains!

Let us not see it! Cover we our eyes, lest we see the End of Man.

Close we our ears, lest we hear the cry of Woman.

Let none speak of it: let none write it: I, I am troubled, my eyes are moist with dews of terror: surely the Bitterness of Death is past.

And I turned me to the South and lo! a great lion^[♌. This is the Beast 666 as yet unprepared for his Work. But already (1900 e.v.) He was dreaded by his fellow Magicians. South: proper place of ☉ in his strength.] as wounded and perplexed.

He cried: I have conquered! Let the Sons of Earth keep silence; for my Name is become as That of Death!

When will men learn the Mysteries of Creation?

How much more those of the Dissolution (and the Pang of Fire)?

I turned me to the West and there was a great Bull^[The Bull is Osiris or Jesus: he complains of the terrible things that are Happening, especially the Freedom (which he thinks shamelessness) or Woman. He does not understand the New Aeon, or that he is about to be destroyed. He is in the West, i.e. going into Oblivion. Cr. West in he 30th Aethyr.]; White with horns of White and Black and Gold. His mouth was scarlet and his eyes as Sapphire stones. With a great sword he shore the skies asunder, and amid the silver flashes of the steel grew lightnings and deep clouds of Indigo.

He spake: It is finished! My mother hath unveiled herself!

My sister hath violated herself! The life of things hath disclosed its Mystery.

The work of the Moon is done! Motion is ended for ever!

Clipped are the eagle's wings: but my Shoulders have not lost their strength.

I heard a Great Voice from above crying: Thou liest! For the Volatile hath indeed fixed itself; but it hath arisen above thy sight. The World is desert: but the Abodes of the House of my Father are peopled; and His Throne is crusted over with white Brilliant Stars, a lustre of bright gems.

In the North is a Man upon a Great Horse, having a Scourge and Balances^[The severest aspect of Justice. Libra] in his hand (or a long spear glitters at his back or in his hand). He is clothed in black velvet and his face is stern and terrible.

He spake saying: I have judged! It is the end: the gate of the beginning. Look in the Beneath and thou shalt see a new world!

I looked and saw a great abyss and a dark funnel of whirling waters or fixed airs, wherein were cities and monsters and trees and atoms and mountains and little flames (being souls) and all the material of an universe.

And all are sucked down one by one, as necessity hath ordained. For below is a glittering jewelled globe of gold and azure, set in a World of Stars.^[Nuit.]


And there came a Voice from the Abyss, saying: "Thou seest the Current of Destiny! Canst thou change one atom in its path? I am Destiny. Dost thou think to control me? for who can move my course?"

And there falleth a thunderbolt therein: a catastrophe of explosion: and all is shattered. And I saw above me a Vast Arm reach down, dark and terrible, and a voice cried: I AM ETERNITY.

And a great mingled cry arose: "No! no! no! All is changed; all is confounded; naught is ordered: the white is stained with blood: the black is kissed of the Christ! Return! Return! It is a new chaos that thou findest here: chaos for thee: for us it is the skeleton of a New Truth!"

I said: Tell me this truth: for I have conjured ye by the Mighty Names of God, the which ye cannot but obey.

The voice said:

Light is consumed as a child in the Womb of its Mother to develop itself anew. But pain and sorrow infinite, and darkness are invoked. For this child riseth up within his Mother and doth crucify himself within her bosom. He extendeth his arms in the arms of his Mother and the Light becometh fivefold ^[The LVX Cross hidden in the Svastika is probably the Arcanum here connoted. This Cross on Mars square adds to 65 Adonai, Shone, Gloried, ha-Yekal HS = keep silence. Svastika itself adds to 231 = 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 21, the 21 Keys. The cubical Svastika regarded as composed of this LVX Cross and the arms has a total of 78 Faces - Tarot and Mezla].

> Lux in Luce,
> Christus in Cruce;
> Tarot and Mezla.
> Deo Duce

Sempiterno.^[This is but the beginning of a sort of hymn. It was never written down, the Seer being unable to hear it properly. These four lines are in fact probably incorrect, certainly incomplete. There were four more lines which he failed to hear &mdash; from fear of getting them wrong.]

And be the glory for ever and ever unto the Most High God, Amen!

Then I returned within my body, giving glory unto the Lord of Light and of the Darkness. In Saecula Saeculorum. Amen!

(On composing myself to sleep, I was shewn an extremely brilliant HEB:Dalet^[Daleth = the Gateway] in the Character of the Passing of the River, in an egg of white light. And I take this as the best of Omens. The letter was extremely vivid and indeed apparently physical. Almost a Dhyana.)

November 17, 1900, Die.

A NOTE^[This note, written before invoking the 28th Aire, represents a crude and imperfect view. It is retained so as to show how very inadequate was the Understanding of the Seer; therefore the immense superiority of the communicating Intelligences and Their separate individual Consciousness.]

Concerning the thirty Aethyrs:

The Visions of the 29th and 30th Aethyrs were given to me in Mexico in August^[Query: November? See above], 1900, and I am now (23.11.9) trying to get the rest. It is to be remarked that the last three aethyrs have ten angels attributed to them^[See *Equinox* I, VII, pp. 243-2], and they therefore represent the ten Sephiroth. Yet these ten form but one, a Malkuth-pendant to the next three, and so on, each set being, as it were, absorbed in the higher. The last set consists, therefore, of the first three aethyrs with the remaining twenty-seven as their Malkuth. And the letters of the first three aethyrs are the key- sigils of the most exalted interpretation of the Sephiroth.

* I is therefore Kether;
* L, Chokmah and Binah;
* A, Chesed;
* N, Geburah;
* R, Tiphereth;
* Z, Netzach;
* N, Hod;
* O, Yesod.

The geomantic correspondences of the Enochian alphabet form a sublime commentary.

Note that the total angels of the aethyrs are 91, the numeration of Amen.


### The Cry of the 28th Aethyr Which is Called BAG^[BAG = ♈♉♋ = ה + ו + ח = 19. הוח = Eve = to manifest, to shew forth.]

There cometh an Angel into the stone with opalescent2^[Opal = rainbow = ♐] shining garments like a wheel^[XIX = The Wheel of the Sun, symbolic of universally radiating energy; and 19 is the glyph of the circle.] of fire on every side of him, and in his hand is a long flail of scarlet lightning^[19 = Angel L.T.D. Of ♐] ; his face is black^[19 = היד was black.] , and his eyes white without any pupil or iris^[References to Binah.]. The face is very terrible indeed to look upon. Now in front of him is a wheel^[See above, note 3.], with many spokes, and many tyres; it is like a fence^[ח = Fence.] in front of him.

And he cries: O man, who art thou that wouldst penetrate the Mystery^[Binah = Eve. 19 is the Great Glyph of the Feminine.]? for it is hidden unto the End of Time.^[Same as above.]

And I answer him: Time^[ת Time = ♄ = Binah.] is not, save in the darkness of Her womb by whom evil came.

And now the wheel breaks away, and I see him as he is. His garment is black beneath the opal veils, but it is lined with white, and he has the shining belly of a fish, and enormous wings of black and white feathers, and innumerable little legs and claws like a centipede, and a long tail like a scorpion. The breasts are human, but they are all scored with blood; and he cries: O thou who hast broken down the veil, knowest thou not that who cometh where I am must be scarred by many sorrows? ^[i.e. must attain to 8x = 3□]

And I answer him: Sorrow13 is not, save in the darkness of the womb of Her by whom came evil.

I pierce the Mystery of his breast , and therein is a jewel^[All are references to Binah.]. It is a sapphire as great as an ostrich egg, and thereon is graven this sigil:

![](img/BAG_Sigil.jpg)

(Figure: This is in the form of two "U" shapes, very elongated in the risers. The one to the right is lower than the first, and its left riser extends 2/3's of the way up inside the center of the one to the left. The left "U" turns back down to the far left, ending 1/5th the way down in a tiny circle. The right bends abruptly horizontally left across the other and also ends there in a tiny circle.)

But there is also much writing on the stone, very minute characters carved. I cannot read them. He points with his flail to the sapphire, which is now outside him and bigger than himself^[Binah absorbs all.]; and he cries: Hail! warden of the Gates of Eternity who knowest not^[Binah destroys knowledge.] thy right hand from thy left^[Hands: ☿: for Hand is Iod, Virgo. Also the two hands are the Twin Serpents. Eyes ☉ & ☾ The Positive and Negative. Executive currents of the Logos. Nostrils ♂ & ♀ The mouth attributed the Mercury in the usual system, cannot be used in this phrase; for the Ears ♃ & ♄ Mouth is One, not Two, being the Logos itself. And the Logos is essentially an Unity, although manifested through Vibration. It is therefore not destroyed with the other objects of Knowledge, though its dual modes of expression, the hands, are no longer known apart.]; for in the aeon of my Father is a god with clasped hands wherein he holdeth the universe, crushing^[See *Liber AL*, III, v. 72] it into the dust that ye call stars.

Hail unto thee who knowest not thy right eye from thy left; for in the aeon of my Father there is but one light.

Hail unto thee who knowest not thy right nostril from thy left; for in the aeon of my Father there is neither life nor death.

Hail unto thee who knowest not thy right ear from thy left; for in the aeon of my Father there is neither sound nor silence.

Whoso hath power to break open this sapphire stone shall find therein four elephants having tusks of mother-of-pearl, and upon whose backs are castles, those castles which ye call the watch-towers of the Universe.^[The Elements are hidden in Binah.]

Let me dwell in peace within the breast of the Angel that is warden of the aethyr. Let not the shame of my Mother be unveiled. Let not her be put to shame that lieth among the lilies that are beyond the stars.

O man, that must ever be opening, when wilt thou learn to seal up the mysteries of the creation? to fold thyself over thyself as a rose in the embrace of night? But thou must play the wanton to the sun, and the wind must tear thy petals from thee, and the bee must rob thee of thy honey, and thou must fall into the dusk of things. Amen and Amen.

Verily the light is hidden, therefore he who hideth himself is like unto the light; but thou openest thyself; thou art like unto the darkness that bindeth the belly of the great goddess^[In the light of the cry of LOE, this passage seems to mean precisely the opposite of its apparent meaning. The whole cry, from "Let me dwell ..." is an Invocation of Binah. It is a foreshadowing of the Mysteries of the Crossing of the Abyss.]

<div class="centered">
OLAHO VIRUDEN MAHORELA ZODIREDA! ON PIREDA EXENTASER;
ARBA PIRE GAH GAHA GAHAL GAHALANA VO ABRA NA GAHA VELUCORSAPAX.</div>^[The translation of this is in my private copy (white and gold binding). Possibly also in the Cefalu set which was copied from that (?) by Estai. (?).]

And the voice of the aeon cried: Return, return, return! the time sickeneth, and the space gapeth, and the voice of him that is, was and shall be crowned rattles in the throat of the mighty dragon of eld.^[Binah or Nuit = Draco, the Dragon]

Thou canst not pass by me, except thou have the mystery of the word of the abyss.

Now the angel putteth back the sapphire stone into his breast; and I spake unto him and said, I will fight with thee and overcome thee, except thou expound unto me the word of the abyss.

Now he makes as if to fight with me. (It is very horrible, all the tentacles moving and the flail flashing, and the fierce eyeless face, strained and swollen.) And with the Magic sword I pierce through his armour to his breast. He fell back, saying: Each of these my scars was thus made, for I am the warden of the aethyr. And he would have said more; but I cut him short, saying: expound the word of the Abyss. And he said^[See the 14th and 13th Aethyr.]: Discipline is sorrowful and ploughing is laborious and age is weariness.

Thou shalt be vexed by dispersion.^[See the 10th Aethyr. These statements are prophetic.]

But now, if the sun arise, fold thou thine arms^[Tiphereth; and the sign of Osiris risen in 5° = 6□.]; then shall God smite thee into a pillar of salt.^[Prophetic of the 8° = 3□ attainment; the pillar is Sea. Cf. Lib. LXV, Cap. V, vv. 5, 23, 25.]

Look not so deeply into words and letters; for this Mystery hath been hidden by the Alchemists. Compose the sevenfold into a fourfold regimen^[The completed system which is made by the 7° = 4□.]; and when thou hast understood thou mayest make symbols^[The 8° = 3□ may devise a new Qabalah.]; but by playing child's games with symbols thou shalt never understand.^[One cannot become 8° = 3□ by intellectual manipulations.]

Thou hast the signs; thou hast the words; but there are many things that are not in my power, who am but the warden of the 28th Aethyr.

Now my name thou shalt obtain in this wise. Of the three angels of the Aethyr, thou shalt write the names from right to left and from left to right and from right to left, and these are the holy letters:

The first 1, the fifth 2, the sixth 3, the eleventh 4, the seventh 5, the twelfth 6, the seventeenth 7.

Thus hast thou my name^[This would appear to be: PXINBAL <--- FOCISNI ---> RAPOLXO <--- = LIXIPSP = ♋ ♐ Spirit ♐ ♌ ♊ ♌ = ח ס ת ס ט ז ט = 553 = ל ו ד ג ה י נ ת = Draco Magnus, the Mighty Dragon. This is the symbol of Nuit or Binah. The whole symbolism of this Angel is therefore exactly confirmed through a Qabalistic equation of which the Seer had no idea at the time. N.B. He is above the dispersion and disorder just as Binah is above the Abyss of Choronzon.] who am above these three, but the angels of the 30th Aethyr are indeed four, and they have none above them; wherefore dispersion and disorder.^[The four elements unharmonized break up into Choronzon.]

Now cometh from every side at once a voice, terribly great, crying: Close the veil; the great blasphemy hath been uttered; the face of my Mother^[Further reference to Binah.] is scarred by the nails of the devil. Shut the book, destroy the breaker of the seal!

And I answered: Had he not been destroyed he had not come hither, for I am not save in the darkness in the womb of Her^[Binah.] by whom came evil into the world.

And this darkness swallows everything up^[Typical gesture of Binah.], and the angel is -------------------- gone from the stone^[The general attribution of this Aethyr is to Atu XVII]; and there is no light therein, save only the light of the Rose and of the Cross.^[Binah being gone, the seer descends to his normal place in Tiphereth.]

### The Cry of the 27th Aethyr, Which is Called ZAA^[ZAA = ♌♉♉ = טוו = 21. A mystery of Atu XVIII, "The Moon". ♓ in which ♀ is exalted.]

There is an angel with rainbow wings, and his dress is green^[Possibly the traditional green of the huntress.] with silver, a green veil over silver^[Colour of ☾.] armour. Flames of many-coloured fire dart from him in all directions. It is a woman of some thirty years old, and she has the moon for a crest, and the moon is blazoned on her heart, and her sandals are curved silver, like the moon.^[The green of Venus is perhaps the natural veil of Luna, her external show.]

And she cries: Lonely am I and cold in the wilderness of the stars.^[For ☾ is virgin, and the path of ג crosses the wilderness of the Abyss.]

For I am the queen of all them that dwell in Heaven, and the queen of all them that are pure upon earth, and the queen of all the sorcerers of hell.^[Diana Trivia is thus described. She is the Virgin Goddess of Pure Love; and the Lady of Heaven. She is the Virgin Goddess of Pure Love; and she is Hecate, the waning Moon, presiding over Witchcraft. (See Macbeth, etc.)]

I am the daughter of Nuit, the lady of the stars. And I am the Bride of them that are vowed unto loneliness.^[♍ = IX = The Hermit (opposite ♓ in the Zodiac).]

And I am the mother of the Dog Cerberus.^[The Jackals of Atu XVIII.] One person am I, and three gods.^[☾ = ג = 3. Cerberus has three heads.]

And thou who hast blasphemed me shalt suffer knowing me. For I am cold as thou art cold, and burn with thy fire.^[For the ☾ is the Sensorium; she reflects man's spiritual state in terms of sensuous experiences.]

Oh, when shall the war of the Aires and the elements be accomplished?^[i.e. the coefficients of the Circle and the Square be commensurable. "When" means "Through what mode of resolution?"—"On what plane?"]

Radiant are these falchions of my brothers, invisibly about me, but the might of the aethyrs beneath my feet beareth me down. And they avail not to sever the Kamailow.^[Καμηλο σ, a camel, i.e. ג Jimmel. Κα μαιλο σ, a rope. And Jimmel is likened to a rope, a threefold (ג = 3) cord linking Kether and Tiphereth.]

There is one in green armour, with green eyes, whose sword is of vegetable fire.^[The Angel of ד = ♀ who is green, and ד "avails" ג, crossing it on the Tree by joining Chokmah and Binah. That is, the Love of these Supernals balances the Isolation of the Virgin Moon.]

They shall avail me. My son is he^[☾ in 20° ♓ at nativity of 666.], &mdash; and how shall I bear him that have not known man?

All this time intolerable rays are shooting forth to beat me back or destroy me; but I am encased in an egg of blue-violet, and my form is the form of a man with the head of a golden hawk.^[i.e. I assume the god-form of Horus, Sol in the Womb of the Night-sky blue of Binah, who is the Mother of all Stars and thus is potent against Hecate.]

While I have been observing this, the goddess has kept up a continuous wail, like the baying of a thousand hounds;^[The hounds that follow Hecate. The jackals of Atu XVIII. Quote A.C. "Ode to Hecate".] and now her voice is deep and guttural and hoarse, and she breathes very rapidly words that I cannot hear. I can hear some of them now.

<span class="centered">**UNTU LA LA ULULA UMUNA TOFA LAMA LE LI NA AHR IMA TAHARA ELULA ETFOMA UNUNA ARPETI ULU ULU ULU MARABAN ULULU MAHATA ULU ULU LAMASTANA.**</span>^[The Lunar language. "Ye hounds! Ho! Ho! Tally-ho! sent the poison of the path—Here! There! Bark! Sweep around! There goes the quarry down the glade of mossy rock. The foremost has caught him. Tally ho! Tally ho! Tally ho! pull him down! Tally-ho boys! Wind the mort! Tally ho! Tally ho! The hunt is ended." ULU = "Hail" plus "come" = very nearly "Ahoy!"]

And then her voice rises to a shriek, and there is a cauldron^[The witches' cauldron.] boiling in front of her; and the flames under the cauldron are like unto zinc flames^[Ultra violet of ♓.], and in the cauldron is the Rose, the Rose of 49 petals^[♀ in ♓.], seething in it. Over the cauldron she has arched her rainbow wings; and her face is bent over the cauldron, and she is blowing opalescent silvery rings on to the Rose; and each ring as it touches the water bursts into flame, and the Rose takes new colours.^[All this paragraph refers to Atu XIV Sagittarius, for she is now in her huntress form. Hence the Alchemical and rainbow symbolism.]

And now she lifts her head, and raises her hands to heaven, and cries: O Mother^[He appeals to Binah, the highest form of Luna.], wilt thou never have compassion on the children of earth? Was it not enough that the Rose should be red with the blood of thine heart^[This is the use to which BABALON puts the Blood of the Masters of the Temple (see 12th Aethyr) to vivify the rose of Universal Creation, i.e. The Attainment of the Master of the Temple fills the World with Life and Beauty. Hecate does not understand this, or else she regards it as hostile to her own Formula.], and that its petals should be by 7 and by 7?

She is weeping, weeping.^[Water of ♓.]

And the tears grow and fill the whole stone with moons.^[She can produce nothing but images of herself.] I can see nothing and hear nothing for the tears, though she keeps on praying. "Take of these pearls^[Pearls, the M.T.'s secreted by Binah round the specks of dust which they have become.], treasure them in thine heart. Is not the Kingdom of the Abyss accurst?" She points downward to the cauldron; and now in it there is the head of a most cruel dragon^[A veil or mask of Khephra (in Atu XVIII).], black and corrupted. I watch, and watch; and nothing happens.

And now the dragon rises out of the cauldron, very long and slim (like Japanese Dragons, but infinitely more terrible), and he blots out the whole sphere of the stone.^[All Hecate can see of the Great Work of 8° = 3□ is the Black Brotherhood; i.e., the failure of that Work.]

Then suddenly all is gone, and there is nothing in the stone save brilliant white light and flecks like sparks of golden fire; and there is a ringing, as if bells were being used for anvils. And there is a perfume which I cannot describe; it is like nothing that one can describe, but the suggestion is like lignum aloes.^[Sagittarius (Atu XIV) again. The phenomena are the experiences of the attained Master of the Temple.] And now all these things are there at once in the same place and time.^[The attainment has destroyed the conditions of physical manifestation.]

Now a veil of olive and silver^[Olive — Water in Malkuth (Queen Scale) also Water (Emperor Scale). Silver is Luna in Queen Scale.] is drawn over the stone, only I hear the voice of the angel^[Hecate now aspires to Binah, accepts the Formula of Love (kisses), surrenders her nature ("Fall back" etc.) and so finds the Word.] receding, very sweet and faint and sorrowful, saying: Far off and lonely in the secret stone is the unknown, and interpenetrated is the knowledge with the will and the understanding. I am alone. I am lost, because I am all and in all; and my veil is woven of the green earth and the web of stars. I love; and I am denied, for I have denied myself. Give me those hands, put them against my heart. Is it not cold? Sink, sink, the abyss of time remains. It is not possible that one should come to ZAA. Give me thy face. Let me kiss it with my cold kisses. Ah! Ah! Ah! Fall back from me. The word, the word of the aeon is **MAKHASHANAH.**^[הנאשאכאמ = 418. A word of 8 letters is necessary to perform the Great work on one whose Formula is 3: 8○ = 3□. The Seer "knew" that this Word was not the correct Word, which is Abrahadabra = 418. But on writing it down in Hebrew, as above, he saw that it was the correct word after all. Observe that this proves the Angel to have been an Intelligence not of the Seer's conscious mind. Had he given the Word which the Seer knew, it might have been derived from his subconscious Self. Furthermore, this Word contains more than the mere 418 because of its 8 letters suiting the special Formula required by this particular Angel, whereas the other Word is a general Formula, being of 11 letters, all Magick being referred to 11. so far as ABRAHADABRA is specialized, it refers to the Work of 5○ = 6□, there being 5 alephs and 6 other letters. In the Latin script also Makhashanah does have 11 letters. Again, the operation of the Cauldron (above) is described by the 5 consonants of this Word. מ = Water (Water) כ = Wheel (Rose) ש = Fire Dee נ = ♏ ה = Binah]

And these words shalt thou say backwards:

<span class="centered">**ARARNAY OBOLO MAHARNA TUTULU NOM LAHARA EN NEDIEZO LO SAD FONUSA SOBANA ARANA BINUF LA LA LA ARPAZNA UOHULU**</span>^[Translation: "Hither, O Holy one/ whose burden pulls at thy spine/ Ho! Ho! Ho! The two-headed God (Janus) ploughs thy back/ sows habitations upon thy back/ thou many-phallused queen/ of princely loves/ which are all sodomies/ so that the holy ones laugh and shake with laughter/ while the lords of mischief/ spend upon thee/ TUTULU (this word cannot be translated. See Liber VII). down bounces from thy back/ the merry mad foetus-faces/ an emission/ Gather ye sun-roses, sun-roses gather ye from the split backside of the Virgin (Earth).]



when thou wilt call my burden unto appearance, for I who am the Virgin goddess am the pregnant goddess, and I have cast down my burden even unto the borders of the universe.^[The Word of the Master has gone forth into every part of the world. Therefore it is always possible to call Him forth to one's assistance by the proper use of the above Formula.] They that blaspheme me are stoned, and my veil^[Symbols of Binah.] is fallen about me even unto the end of time.^[Same as above.]

Now there arises a great raging of thousands and thousands of mighty warriors flashing through the aethyr so thickly that nothing is to be seen but their swords, which are like blue-gray plumes. And the noise is confused, thousands of battle-cries harmonizing to a roar, like the roar of a monstrous river in flood. And all the stone is dull, dull gray. The life is gone from it.^[Many of these Visions end in some way unconnected with the substance of the Aethyr. One must not look for coherence in such places. They are merely episodes on the return journey, useful to break the shock. analogy: one might see a cab accident while returning to one's house from the theatre. This spectacle need have no connection with either the play or one's home life.]

There is no more to see.
