<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>“the keen:” these are the men whose Will is as a sword sharp and straight, tempered and ground and polished its flawless steel; with a Wrist and an Eye behind it.</p>
<p>“the proud:” these are the men who know themselves to be stars, and bend the knee to none. True pride prevents a man from doing aught unworthy of himself.</p>
<p>“the royal:” these are the men whose nature is kingly, the men who ‘can.’ They know themselves born rulers, whether their halidom be Art, or Science, or aught else soever.</p>
<p>“The lofty:” these are the men who, being themselves high-hearted, endure not any baseness.</p>
