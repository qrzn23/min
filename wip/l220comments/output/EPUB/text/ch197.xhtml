<h3>III.49.</h3>
<p><em>I am in a secret fourfold word, the blasphemy against all gods of men.</em></p>
<section id="the-old-comment-193" class="level4">
<h4>The Old Comment</h4>
<p>(48-62.) Appears to be a plain instruction in theology and ethics.</p>

<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>The evident interpretation of this is to take the word to be “Do what thou wilt,” which is a secret word, because its meaning for every man is his own inmost secret. And it is the most profound blasphemy possible against all ‘gods of men,’ because it makes every man his own God.</p>
<p>We may then take it that this Solar-Phallic Ra Ha is Each Man Himself. As each independent cell in our bodies is to us, so is each of us to Heru-Ra-Ha. Each man’s ‘child’-consciousness is a Star in the Cosmos of the Sun, as the Sun is a Star in the Cosmos of Nuith.</p>
<p>(Serious students should consult Chapter 2 of Liber 333, and the Commentary thereof. “Q.V.I.F.” is “Quif”, an onomatopaeic rendition of the cry of a hawk in flight.)</p>
