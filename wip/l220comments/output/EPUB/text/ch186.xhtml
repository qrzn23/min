<h3>III.38.</h3>
<p>So that thy light is in me; &amp; its red flame is as a sword in my hand to push thy order. There is a secret door that I shall make to establish thy way in all the quarters, (these are the adorations, as thou hast written), as it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The light is mine; its rays consume<br />
Me: I have made a secret door<br />
Into the House of Ra and Tum,<br />
Of Khephra and of Ahathoor.<br />
I am thy Theban, O Mentu,<br />
The prophet Ankh-af-na-khonsu!</p>
<p>By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat;<br />
By wise Ta-Nech I weave my spell.<br />
Show thy star-splendour, O Nuit!<br />
Bid me within thine House to dwell,<br />
O wingèd snake of light, Hadit!<br />
Abide with me, Ra-Hoor-Khuit!</p>
