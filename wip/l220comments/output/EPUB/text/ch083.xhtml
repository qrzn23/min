<h4>The Djeridensis Comment</h4>
<p>He prepared me to receive a doctrine of such fearful import, so hateful at every point to every part of my spirit and soul (such as they seemed to me in my blindness and bondage) that He deemed it prudent to test me through and through, to warn me, and to give me time to brace myself to meet the fury of the tempest of His Word.</p>

<h4>The Old Comment</h4>
<p>Enough has been said of the Nature of Hadit, now let a riddle of L.V.X. be propounded.</p>

<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>The subject changes. Hadit will give an Exordium upon Himself in the next two verses. Then He will propound an ethical doctrine so terrible and strange that men will be “devoured and eaten up with blindness” because of it.</p>
<p>(Serious readers should consult Liber LXV and Liber VII on this light that “devours men and eats them up with blindness.” Particularly LXV, i, 12-19, 24; ii, 30-32; iv, 54-55, 65; and VII, iv, 8-15, 25, 48-49; vi, 20-25, 47; vii, 28-33, 36-44.)</p>
