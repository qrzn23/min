<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>For the images in this and the next verse see the Stele of Revealing, to which they allude.</p>
<p>The Serpent is the Uraeus, with the powers of Life and Death, wise, ecstatic, immortal; winged and hooded, that he may go as a god swiftly and silently. It refers in this place especially to Hadit.</p>
<p>(In them, Kundalini must have reached the Ajna.)</p>
