<p><em>I am the Hawk-Headed Lord of Silence &amp; of Strength; my nemyss shrouds the night-blue sky.</em></p>

<h4>The Old Comment</h4>
<p>(70-72.) A final pronouncement of His attributes. I do not know the exact meaning of v. 71. [Later, Sun in Libra, An VII. Yes: I do.]</p>

<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>It is important to observe that He claims to be both Horus and Harpocrates; and this two-in-one is a Unity combining Tao and Teh, Matter &amp; Motion, Being &amp; Form. This is natural, for in Him must exist the Root of the Dyad.</p>
<p>“my nemyss” (better spelt ‘nemmes’) is the regular head-dress of a God. It is a close cap, but with wings behind the ears which end in lappets that fall in front of the shoulders. It is gathered at the nape of the neck into a cylindrical ‘pigtail’. I think the shape is meant to suggest the Royal Uraeus serpent.</p>
<p>It “shrouds the night-blue sky” because the actual light shed by the God when he is invoked is of this colour. It may also mean that he conceals Nuith.</p>
<p>The Hawk’s Head symbolizes keen sight, swift action, courage and mobility.</p>
