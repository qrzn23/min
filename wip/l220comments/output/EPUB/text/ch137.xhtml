<h3>II.68.</h3>
<p><em>Harder! Hold up thyself! Lift thine head! breathe not so deep — die!</em></p>

<h4>The Djeridensis Comment</h4>
<p>(61-68.) The scent of battle in my nostrils avails at least to awake my manhood, to arouse my Godhead within me. Throughout this chapter I had rebelled again and again against my Master; but now the darkness broke and fled. My True Self flamed up in me. I become one with Hadit; I entered into trance at once. A sudden light blazed in my eyes. Hadit arose within my heart; and on the instant I was thrilled with the love of Nuit. She came to me more swiftly than the light itself. My body was smitten by the kisses of the stars. When I breathed in, my flesh fell from me like rotten rags. I breathed out and felt a kiss swifter, more laughterful than death itself. Utter relief from all the deceits with which my brain had been blinded. I need not enter into detail of this trance. The text describes the facts better in every way than could be done in any other manner.</p>

<h4>The Old Comment</h4>
<p>(67-68.) So violently that the body of the prophet is nigh death.</p>
<p>(Harden, not Harder, as the MS. indicates. The memory of DCLXVI says, though with diffidence, that the former is correct.)</p>

<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>It is remarkable that this extraordinary Experience has practically no effect upon the normal consciousness of THe Beast. “Intoxicate the inmost, o my God” – and it was His Magical Self, 666, that was by this Ecstasy initiated. It needed years for this Light to dissolve the husks of accident that shrouded his True Seed.</p>
