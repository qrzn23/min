<p>Nuit is known by the Word of a Riddle of Letter and Number: this also will I make plain in other writings.</p>

<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>One must observe the special significance of these numbers, not only conjoined, but separate. For 6, Vau, is the Bull; and 50, Nun, the Scorpion. But 6 is also the number of the Sun, our Star. The N of Nu is therefore the Dragon – “Infinite Space” – and V is “the Infinite Stars” thereof. The ITH is the honorific termination representing Her fulfilment of Creative Force. “I” being the Inmost Force, and “Th” its Extension.</p>
<p>The Dragon in current symbolism refers to the North or Hollow of Heaven; thus to the Womb of Space, which is the container and breeder of all that exists.</p>
<p>Liber AlephLiber Aleph should be consulted for further information as to the magical import of Scorpio and Taurus.</p>
<p>(See Liber NV for this. But obviously, N=50, V=6.)</p>
