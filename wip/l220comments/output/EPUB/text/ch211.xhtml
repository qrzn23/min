<h3>III.63.</h3>
<p><em>The fool readeth this Book of the Law, and its comment; &amp; he understandeth it not.</em></p>

<p>A fact.</p>

<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>The Fool is also the Great Fool, Bacchus Diphues, Harpocrates, the Dwarf-Self, the Holy Guardian Angel, and so forth. “He understandeth it not”, that is, he understandeth that it is NOT, LA, 31.</p>
<p>But the above is only the secondary or hieroglyphic magical meaning. The plain English still discusses the technique of initiation. The ‘fool’, is one such as described in my note on verse 57. The vain, soft, frivolous, idle, mutable sot will make nothing either of this Book, or of my comment thereon. (The „comment‟ mentioned in the verse is The Comment in Class A.) But this fool is the child Harpocrates, the “Babe in the Egg”, the innocent not yet born, in silence awaiting his hour to come forth into light. He is then the uninitiated man, and he has four ordeals to pass before he is made perfect. These ordeals are now to be described.</p>
