<h3>III.21.</h3>
<p><em>Set up my image in the East: thou shalt buy thee an image which I will show thee, especial, not unlike the one thou knowest. And it shall be suddenly easy for thee to do this.</em></p>

<h4>The Old Comment</h4>
<p>This was remarkably fulfilled.</p>

<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>Verses 21 - 31 seem to refer to the rites of public worship of Ra-Hoor-Khuit.</p>
<p>(Nothing of the sort. The rites of worship shall always remain private. See the The Mass of the Phoenix, Liber XLIV.)</p>
<p>The word “Set” is curious – is there here a reference to Set the God?</p>
<p>With regard to the Old Comment, I did indeed find an image of the kind implied. But there seems no special importance in this. I am inclined to see some deeper significance in this passage. There has elsewhere been reference to the words “not”, “one”, “Thou knowest”. The word “easy” is moreover suggestive of some mystery; it is used in the same doubtfully intelligible sense in verse 40.</p>
<p>(This verse can be taken literally in the strictest sense. It depends on the reader.)</p>
