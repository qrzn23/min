<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>It is not altogether clear whether the beetles or the Cakes are referred to in this strange passage. The proper way to discover the truth of this is to experiment.</p>
<p>(If it be the beetles, there is a recipe for insects very popular in the Middle East which seems to fit the conditions.</p>
<p>Pound the insects into a mess; dig a hole in the ground; pour the mess in; let it ferment for several days. When it is so ripe it smells, take it out and toast it dry in an oven. Then season it and fry it in olive oil and eat it.)</p>
<p>There is a considerable amount of evidence in my possession which throws light upon this part of the chapter; but no important purpose would be served by producing it at present. These are circumstances when apparent frankness defeats its own ends as well as those of policy.</p>
