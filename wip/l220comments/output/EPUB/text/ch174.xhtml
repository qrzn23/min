<p>See Liber 418, First Aethyr, final paragraphs.</p>
<p>(Serious students will understand that “they shall fall before you” does not necessarily mean that you shall slay them. Also, unserious students had better beware of trying to employ this magickal formula: “thou hast no right but to do thy will.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the following apologue will be of help:</p>
<p>A profane slew a beetle before Ra-Hoor-Khuit, naming a person he considered his enemy; and soon after, the profane went mad.</p>
<p>An Initiate slew a beetle before R-Hoor-Khuit, naming a person he considered his enemy; and soon after, this person fell before him.</p>
<p>An Exempt Adept slew a beetle before Ra-Hoor-Khuit, naming the person he considered his worst enemy, that is, himself; and soon after, he became a Master of the Temple.</p>
