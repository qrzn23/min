<h2>THE TUNIS COMMENT</h2>
<p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>The study of this Book is forbidden. It is wise to destroy this copy after the first reading.</p>
<p>Whosoever disregards this does so at his own risk and peril. These are most dire.</p>
<p>Those who discuss the contents of this Book are to be shunned by all, as centres of pestilence.</p>
<p>All questions of the Law are to be decided only by appeal to my writings, each for himself.</p>
<p>There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>The priest of the princes,</p>
<p>Ankh-f-n-khonsu</p>

<p>This is the Comment in Class A., the only Comment to Liber AL in this Class. All other Commentaries by Aleister Crowley (here printed in common type) are in Class B. All Commentaries „by another‟ (of which this is one) are here printed in italics, and belong in Class C. Let all our successors keep their Commentaries in Class C., except he who shall discover the meaning of the numbers &amp; the words in AL II.76.</p>
