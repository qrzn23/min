<p>Next, he set me a fresh task. I was to assign values to English letters of some such order as obtains in Hebrew. I deal fully with this matter elsewhere.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></p>

<p>done. See Liber Trigrammaton, Comment.</p>

<section id="the-new-comment-120" class="level4">
<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>The attribution in Liber Trigrammaton is good theoretically; but no Qabalah of merit has arisen therefrom. (Surely it is a little early for that; a good Qabalah may take a few hundred years to unfold.) I am inclined to look further into the question of Sanskrit Roots, and into the Enochian Records, in order to put this matter in more polished shape.</p>
<p>I append Liber Trigrammaton with the attribution aforesaid.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></p>

<p><strong>Here is Nothing under its three forms. It is not, yet informeth all things.</strong></p>
<p><em>Narrowed breath. Represents concentration, including aspiration.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file1.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ L ]</p>
<p><strong>Now cometh the glory of the Single One, as an imperfection and stain.</strong></p>
<p><em>Passive undulation, without effort, unchecked.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file2.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ C ]</p>
<p><strong>But by the Weak One the Mother was it equilibrated.</strong></p>
<p><em>Vide S. and K.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file3.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ H ]</p>
<p><strong>Also the purity was divided by Strength, the force of the Demiurge.</strong></p>
<p><em>Forcible addition of pure breath to other sounds. Represents effort.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file4.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ X ]</p>
<p><strong>And the Cross was formulated in the Universe that as yet was not.</strong></p>
<p><em>Combines K &amp; S.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file5.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ T ]</p>
<p><strong>But now the Imperfection became manifest, presiding over the fading of perfection.</strong></p>
<p><em>The sexual onslaught. A less responsible form of D.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file6.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ Y ]</p>
<p><strong>Also the Woman arose, and veiled the Upper Heaven with her body of stars.</strong></p>
<p><em>When distinct from I, dignifies the vowel to which it is prefixed.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file7.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ P ]</p>
<p><strong>Now then a giant arose, of terrible strength; and asserted the Spirit in a secret rite.</strong></p>
<p><em>As to B as K is to (hard) G. Bursting of a bud as against that of a fruit.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file8.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ A ]</p>
<p><strong>And the Master of the Temple balancing all things arose; his stature was above the Heaven and below Earth and Hell.</strong></p>
<p><em>Open unmodulated breath. (ah.)</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file9.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ J ]</p>
<p><strong>Against him the Brothers of the Left-hand Path, confusing the symbols. They concealed their horror [in this symbol]; for in truth they were</strong>.<img src="../media/file10.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>J Like soft G.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file11.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ W ]</p>
<p><strong>The master flamed forth as a star and set a guard of Water in every Abyss.</strong></p>
<p><em>When distinct from U represents the operation of choice. ’U” does this to some extent. (Will, word, way.)</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file12.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ O ]</p>
<p><strong>Also certain secret ones concealed the Light of Purity in themselves, protecting it from the Persecutions.</strong></p>
<p><em>The breath concentrated and directed. As to I as magic is to mysticism.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file13.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ G ]</p>
<p><strong>Likewise also did certain sons and daughters of Hermes and of Aphrodite, more openly.</strong></p>
<p><em>(hard) Opening as if to devour. (Soft?)</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file14.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ Z ]</p>
<p><strong>But the Enemy confused them. They pretended to conceal that Light, that they might betray it, and profane it.</strong></p>
<p><em>An irritated or excited form of S, emphasizing elements of anger and alarm.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file15.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ B ]</p>
<p><strong>Yet certain holy nuns concealed the secret in songs upon the lyre.</strong></p>
<p><em>Bursting forth. Phallus and Vulva. Kissing.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file16.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ F ]</p>
<p><strong>Now did the Horror of Time pervert all things, hiding the Purity with a loathsome thing, a thing unnameable.</strong></p>
<p><em>Compound of P &amp; H.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file17.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ S ]</p>
<p><strong>Yea, and there arose sensualists upon the firmament, as a foul stain of storm upon the sky.</strong></p>
<p><em>Devence, warning, etc.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file18.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ M ]</p>
<p><strong>And the Black Brothers raised their heads; yea, they unveiled themselves without shame or fear.</strong></p>
<p><em>The Will to Die.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file19.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ N ]</p>
<p><strong>Also there rose up a soul of filth and of weakness, and it corrupted all the rule of the Tao.</strong></p>
<p><em>The vibration which includes Life and Death as complementary Curves.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file20.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ E ]</p>
<p><strong>Then only was Heaven established to bear sway; for only in the lowest corruption is form manifest.</strong></p>
<p><em>Softened, but otherwise unmodulated breath.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file21.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ R ]</p>
<p><strong>Also did Heaven manifest in violent light,</strong></p>
<p><em>Continuous vibration, like L but active.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file22.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ Q ]</p>
<p><strong>And in soft light.</strong></p>
<p><em>Combines K + U.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file23.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ V ]</p>
<p><strong>Then were the waters gathered together from the heaven,</strong></p>
<p><em>Conscious male will. Manhood, strength, truth, righteousness, immortality, integrity.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file24.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ K ]</p>
<p><strong>Opening as if startled.</strong></p>
<p><em>And a crust of earth concealed the core of flame.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file25.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ D ]</p>
<p><strong>Around the globe gathered the wide air,</strong></p>
<p><em>The paternal vibration.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file26.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>[ U ]</p>
<p><strong>Like O with added refinement and a tinge of melancholy. O is completely self-confident. (Vulva).</strong></p>
<p><em>And men began to light fires upon the earth.</em></p>
<p><img src="../media/file27.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Therefore was the end of it sorrow; yet in that sorrow a sixfold star of glory whereby they might see to return unto the stainless Abode; yea, unto the Stainless Abode.</strong></p>

I.e. in the comment to Liber Trigrammaton (in, for example, Equinox IV (1), Commentaries on the Holy Books and other papers) where the letters of the English Alphabet are assigned to the trigrams. It is not clear what numerical values, if any, Crowley assigned. Various other systems of “English Qabalah” have since been devised by more recent writers. – V.C.</p>

<p><a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">2</a>. Although the main body of this Liber is Class A, the attribution of letters to the English Alphabet is not of that level. These letters were added at a later date by Crowley, and with the later revisions of Liber DCCLXXVII, form one approach toward an English Qabalah. These letters are positioned below the trigrams in this text with commentary appended.</p>
