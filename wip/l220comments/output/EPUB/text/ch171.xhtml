<h3>III.23.</h3>
<p><em>For perfume mix meal &amp; honey &amp; thick leavings of red wine: then oil of Abramelin and olive oil, and afterward soften &amp; smooth down with rich fresh blood.</em></p>

<h4>The Old Comment</h4>
<p>(23-25.) This incense was made; and the prediction most marvellously fulfilled.</p>

<section id="the-new-comment-167" class="level4">
<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>Meal: ordinary wheaten flour.</p>
<p>Leavings: the “beewing” of port should be good.</p>
<p>Oil of Abramelin: take eight parts of oil of cinnamon, four of oil of myrrh, two of oil of galangal, seven of olive oil.</p>
<p>{WEH NOTE: This is not the recipe given in Abramelin, though it seems at first correct. That recipe took the proportions from the dry ingredients. If the essential oils are used instead at the same proportion, the mixture will be much too strong. In fact, the oil of cinnamon may injure the eyes or raise blisters if used at this strength!}</p>
