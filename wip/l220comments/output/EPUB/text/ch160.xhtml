<p>(12-15.) This, read in connexion with verse 43, was then fulfilled May 1, 1906, o.s. The tragedy was also part of mine initiation, as described in The Temple of Solomon the King. It is yet so bitter that I care not to write of it.</p>

<p>(He refers to the death of two children: one by Rose, the first Scarlet Woman; the other by Leah, the second. The children simply wasted away and he could do nothing for them. Crowley was extremely fond of children, his or anybody else‟s. He was deeply upset when people accused him of preaching child sacrifice.)</p>
