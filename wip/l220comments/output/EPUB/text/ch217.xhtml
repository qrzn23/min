<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>My memory tells me that the word “there” was not emphasized. Read, then, “there is” as the French “Il y a”; it is a simple and apparently detached statement. It was spoken casually, carelessly, as if a quite unimportant point had been forgotten, and now mentioned as a concession to my weakness.</p>
