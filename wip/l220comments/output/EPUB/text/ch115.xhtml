<p><em>Dost thou fail? Art thou sorry? Is fear in thine heart?</em></p>

<h4>The Djeridensis Comment</h4>
<p>(46-47.) The Angel goes on to challenge me point blank as to my own soul. Failure, sorrow, and fear simply cannot exist in the presence of Hadit. His nature is to succeed, to rejoice, and to dare to cause event after event, sure of itself in any and every case.</p>

<h4>The Old Comment</h4>
<p>The prophet was again perplexed and troubled; for in his soul was Compassion for all beings.</p>
<p>But though this Compassion is a feeling perhaps admirable and necessary for mortals, yet it pertains to the planes of Illusion.</p>

<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>This verse brings out what is a fact in psychology, the necessary connection between fear, sorrow, and failure. To will and to dare are closely linked Powers of the Sphinx, and they are based on – to know. If one have a right apprehension of the Universe, if he know himself free, immortal, boundless, infinite force and fire, then may he will and dare. Fear, sorrow and failure are but phantoms.</p>
