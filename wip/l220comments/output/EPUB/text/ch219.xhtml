<p><em>Hail! ye twin warriors about the pillars of the world! for your time is nigh at hand.</em></p>

<h4>The Old Comment</h4>
<p>(70-72.) A final pronouncement of His attributes. I do not know the exact meaning of v. 71. [Later, Sun in Libra, An VII. Yes: I do.]</p>

<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>This is a clear statement as to the War which was to come, and did come, in 1914 E.V.</p>
<p>I now (An XIX Sol in Libra) no longer agree with the above paragraph. I think “the pillars of the world” mean “the Pillars of Hercules” – about the Straits of Gibraltar. And I think the really big war will start “there”.</p>
<p>P.S. An (Sept. 8, ’37, E.V.) Can “twin warriors” imply a “civil” war? The Spanish troubles started in S. Spain and Morocco.</p>
<p>(The verse may refer to a great seismic catastrophe, similar to that which destroyed Atlantis, to occur in the Eighties.)</p>
