<h4>The Old Comment</h4>
<p>(48-62.) Appears to be a plain instruction in theology and ethics.</p>

<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>{WEH NOTE: There is no New Comment to this verse.}</p>
<p>(To “curse them” is part of the Initiatic process. You can’t rise above them as long as you are psychologically in awe of them. Eventually you learn to ignore them, but until you do, you must make cursing them an actual rite. Particularly those “gods” which you were taught to worship by your parents.</p>
<p>Emotional habits are just as difficult to eradicate or to create as any other habits. You drill yourself out of them or into them by routine — dreary, long routine. The difference is — and it is the whole difference! — that you create or destroy your habits deliberately. As a rule, it takes at least three months — a station of the sun — to establish a momentum in consciousness. It may take a lifetime to get rid of it.)</p>
