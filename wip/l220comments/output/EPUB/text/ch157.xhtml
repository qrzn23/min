<h4>The Old Comment</h4>
<p>May mystically describe this method [“e.g.”, Liber HHH, Section 3].</p>
<p>But the course of history will determine the sense of the passage.</p>

<h4>The New Comment</h4>
<p>“Lurk! Withdraw! Upon them!” describes the three parts of a certain magical gesture indicative of a formula which has proven very powerful in practical work.</p>
<p>(For “Lurk!” see Liber 333, Ch. 19, and the Commentary thereon.)</p>
<p>(The events beginning in An XVII Sol in Libra, when I write these words, and ending I do not yet know when, will form a luminous comment on the passage. There is an alternative, taking the beginning as An X sol in Libra, and implying larger periods).</p>
