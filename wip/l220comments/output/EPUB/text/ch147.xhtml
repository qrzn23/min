<h4>The Djeridensis Comment</h4>
<p>Now there is no more “hiding of Hadit”. He hath come forth in blinding light. Only one thing remains to say, “blessing &amp; worship to the prophet of the lovely Star” who by the “love under will” of his Holy Guardian Angel attained to break down his false self and cast it from him; thus become the Voice by which the light of truth could shine upon the night of the Slave-gods, and herald the dawn of the Aeon of the Crowned and Conquering Child.</p>
